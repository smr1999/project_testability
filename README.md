# Testability project

In this project, we want to read bench file and create a network of gate and then inject values into input terminals and calculate gate result in each layer until we reach to output terminals. 

After that we want to perform **Deductive Fault Simulation** to find faults can be found in each wire.

To run this project, follow these instructions:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
